## Analysis of Life Expectancy by Continent

We hypothesize that life expectancy is a function of time and location. This analysis attempts to check that relationship.

**Note**



```{r, echo=FALSE, message= FALSE}
d <- readr::read_csv(here("data/gapminder/raw/gapminder_data.csv"))
d %>%
  filter(continent =="Asia") %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_line(aes(x= year, y= pop,
                  group = country, color= country))


```

##Details
The data consists of years from 'r range(d$year)'.
